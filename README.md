With more than four years of seasoned expertise as a Senior Software Engineer, I focus on crafting reliable software solutions utilizing established methodologies. I primarily work with technologies such as Typescript, Python, Go, and C++. For UI/UX design, I typically prefer React (Remix) or HTMX. Outside the realm of programming, I relish my time on the ski slopes, enjoy strumming on my guitars, and unwind by indulging in movies and TV shows.
